## Considerations for all commands
- t6alh organizes images in to folders with names like `001` where each folder corresponds to a confocal acquisition, such as a czi scene
- Most commands have optional arguments for a variable number folder names. Or an --image-folders-file argument which is the path to a file with this information

## Align commands
